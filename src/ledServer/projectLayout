*-------------------HEAD-------------------*
this project is a communication server for the arduino led setup 

-General organization:
there should be no use of user input scanners outside of the main class. 
all input in the main class should be handled by one method with variables. 
This will allow easy expansion to the GUI.


-Layout:
	-Communication:
		all communication related things will be handled by the SerialCom class. All serial data should be properly encapsulated inside this class.
			-Communication Protocol
				Communication in this is fairly simple, data is sent to the arduino in the form of commands that are then parsed.
				recieving data is done much in the same way through the use of a scanner. If the issue of too much data being sent comes up it may be 
				nessisary to use a confirmation system were the arduino waits to send data till there is confirmation on the server end
